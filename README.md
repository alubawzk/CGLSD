 - A more detailed clarification of the difference between the line segment detection and the wireframe parsing is provided in the 'supplementary material.pdf'.
 - We will release our constructed RENOIR-LineSegment dataset and the proposed CGLSD once the paper is published.
- Some examples of the RLS are shown as follows.
